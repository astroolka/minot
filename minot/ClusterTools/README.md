# ClusterTools : a bunch of tools that are useful when dealing with clusters

- cluster_profile: 
	gather useful profiles definitions and numerical tools

- cluster_global:
	tools related to the global properties of clusters

- cluster_spectra:
	tools related to the gamma ray spectral properties of clusters

- map_tools:
	tools to deal with maps, header and coordinates

- cluster_electron_emission:
        class which deals with cluster emission related to cosmic ray electrons. It includes synchrotron and inverse Compton

- cluster_electron_loss:
        bunch of functions which compute energy losses of electrons

- cluster_hadronic_emission_kafexhiu2014:
        class that implement hadronic emission based on Kafexhiu et al. (2014)

- cluster_hadronic_emission_kelner2006:
        class that implement hadronic emission based on Kerlner et al. (2006)

- cluster_szspec:
        compute Sunyaev-Zel-dovich spectrum

- cluster_xspec:
        set of modules used to work with XSPEC. These tools require XSPEC to be installed

- plotting_style:
        update matplotlib.plt raparms with a given dictionary
